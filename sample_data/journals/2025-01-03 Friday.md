- [x] **15:39** Just watched The Legend of the Bhagat Singh movie! Sooo inspiring this movie! The characters are just soo beautiful souls! Bhagat Singh has turned the suffering he's seen in his childhood into a Purpose for his life since childhood. He died at just 23! And the level of depth he has in his thoughts, character and inner strength! Unbelievable character! Only God's Grace can give someone such strength! But he doesn't even believe in "God" but only in Social equality with all his **heart**! That's what gives him strength I feel. I'm writing this in present tense about him. Maybe he's still very much alive as a soul along with other amazingly beautiful souls! #gratitude 
- [x] **15:45** And I'm grateful that I can watch a movie on him and get inspired while sitting in my own room in 2025 when Bhagat Singh is not even here or on this planet in human form! I don't even need anyone else to inspire me perhaps with such content available on the internet! Modern tech has made it possible! Beautiful stuff! #gratitude
